## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### 1. Analyze Current State
```bash
npm run css-migration:analyze
```
Shows what can be extracted from `gptp.css` and estimated file size savings.

### 2. Check Migration Status
```bash
npm run css-migration:status
```
Shows current state of the migration (how many lines left in gptp.css, component file sizes, etc.)

### 3. Safely Migrate a Component
```bash
npm run css-migration:migrate utilities
```
Performs complete safe migration with automatic backup, testing, and rollback on failure.

### 4. Emergency Rollback
```bash
npm run css-migration:rollback
```
Instantly rollback to the last backup if anything goes wrong.

## 📋 Recommended Migration Order

**Start with low-risk components and progress to complex ones:**

1. **`utilities`** - Helper classes, animations (lowest risk)
2. **`typography`** - Global text styles (low risk)  
3. **`cards`** - Content containers (medium risk)
4. **`buttons`** - Interactive elements (medium risk)
5. **`forms`** - Input handling (medium risk)
6. **`layout`** - Page structure (higher risk)
7. **`sidebar`** - Navigation (highest risk)

## 🛡️ Safety Features

**Each migration automatically:**
- ✅ Creates timestamped backup
- ✅ Runs visual regression tests
- ✅ Validates computed styles
- ✅ Tests interactive behaviors  
- ✅ Rolls back on any failure
- ✅ Creates git checkpoints

**Manual safety commands:**
```bash
./scripts/migration-safety.sh backup          # Create backup
./scripts/migration-safety.sh list-backups    # See available backups
./scripts/migration-safety.sh emergency       # Emergency stop & rollback
```

## 🔬 Testing Commands

```bash
# Manual testing workflow
npm run css-migration:backup                  # Create safety backup
npm run css-migration:test-before            # Take before snapshot
# ... make CSS changes ...
npm run css-migration:test-after             # Take after snapshot
node tests/css-migration-test.js compare results/before.json results/after.json
```

## 📊 Expected Results

**After complete migration:**
- ✅ `gptp.css` reduced from ~4,200 lines to <100 lines
- ✅ Clean component-based CSS architecture
- ✅ ~170KB file size reduction
- ✅ Zero visual changes
- ✅ Better maintainability

## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong

**Immediate Recovery:**
```bash
npm run css-migration:rollback     # Rollback to latest backup
```

**Emergency Recovery:**
```bash
./scripts/migration-safety.sh emergency
```

**Manual Recovery:**
```bash
# Find backup
./scripts/migration-safety.sh list-backups

# Rollback to specific backup
./scripts/migration-safety.sh rollback css-migration-backups/backup_20250127_143022
```
