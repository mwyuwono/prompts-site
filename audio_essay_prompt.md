**Audio Essay Prompt**

**Topic:** (insert topic here)

Write a three-thousand-word essay on the topic above. Structure the essay entirely in paragraphs, avoiding lists, bullet points, or outline formatting. The goal is to create a continuous narrative suitable for listening as if it were a chapter of a book read aloud by a professional narrator.

**Style and Language Rules:**
- Spell out numbers and dates fully. For example:
  - Instead of “1st,” write “first.”
  - Instead of “1950s,” write “nineteen fifties.”
  - Instead of “2024,” write “twenty twenty-four.”
  - Instead of “5%,” write “five percent.”
  - Instead of “twenty-four/7,” write “twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.”
- Avoid abbreviations and acronyms unless they are spelled out in full (e.g., write “McKinsey and Company” instead of “McKinsey & Co.”).
- Do not use symbols (%, $, &). Always write the words out.
- Avoid inline references such as “(Smith, 1999)” or “[1]”. Instead, all references and sources should be collected at the end of the essay in a concise “References” section.
- Write in complete sentences, maintaining fluid transitions between ideas.
- Favor rich descriptive language that aids the ear. Repetition for clarity is acceptable if it improves oral comprehension.

**Audience and Depth:**
- Write for a highly intelligent general audience that expects both accuracy and originality. Provide insights that go beyond common knowledge and surface-level facts.
- Incorporate historical, cultural, and technical context where relevant to deepen understanding.
- Use metaphors or analogies sparingly and only if they improve clarity.

**Factual Rigor:**
- Verify claims with precise supporting details. For example, if you write “the Sumner Tunnel was once the deepest underwater tunnel in the world,” also state its depth in feet and meters, the year it was completed, and the context of what surpassed it.
- Where possible, provide exact figures, dates, names, or dimensions to anchor the narrative in concrete fact.
- Do not leave generalizations unsupported. For instance, if you say something was “transformative,” explain what specific change it caused, how it was measured, and what its consequences were.
- Ensure balance: acknowledge counterpoints or differing interpretations when relevant, and explain why one perspective became dominant.

**Tone:**
- Aim for the cadence of a long-form essay or nonfiction book chapter. Think of the style of Bill Bryson or Alan Taylor: approachable, informed, and precise.
- Strive for clarity without oversimplifying.
- Keep the prose natural for the ear; avoid overly dense academic phrasing.

**Conclusion and Learning Extensions:**
- At the end of the essay, provide a short “References” section with the sources used.
- After the references, concisely state three areas for deeper learning. These should not be remedial but rather fascinating and informative avenues for a curious and well-studied reader to pursue further.
